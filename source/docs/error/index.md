If you're new to programming, let me explain. I previously used [Power Format Pack](https://gitlab.com/neftas/supplementary-buttons-anki/issues/96), [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com), [Moustache](https://mustache.github.io) and [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) — all of which are great, until ...

A tool or a piece of software that's still around in 5 years, without any serious changes, [is a good thing](https://github.com/badlydrawnrob/anki/issues/53). Choose [boring technology](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology) when stability matters!
